== Unreleased

 * Refactor to make compilable on stable release channel. Remove `TryFrom`
   since that's still only availbable on nightly. Call
   `DrawingCommands::try_to_geometry(x)` to convert to geometry.

== v0.3.0

 * Performance improvements from reducing gzip compression
 * Use `Rc<String>` more often to allow users to reduce memory usage

== v0.2.0

 * Actual error handling, instead of panic when invalid geometries are
   encountered
